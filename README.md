Hello, my name is Robin Strife! Nice to meet you!
I am an ACMP major at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, with a minor in Japanese and a TESOL certification.
My hobbies include screwing around on Linux, gaming (both development and playing), media history (ask me about visual novels!), and exploring older technology.
I plan to move to Japan post graduation, and am currently in my second year of Japanese language classes. 

読んだからありがとうございました！Thank you for reading!
